👋 Hi, I’m Kris K. 

🤘 I'm an entrepreneur at heart, in love with working on impactful projects and good people.

₿ Also, I'm a huge crypto activist. I believe that blockchain technology is the new foundation on which new (internet) access to information will be built on.

🎩 My professional manifesto: Sales professional + partnerships manager + pragmatic creative dreamer = me. #realSlimShady

🕺 I like music, activism, philanthropy. Sometimes I write, I play the guitar, I sketch, and I dance salsa. 

📧 You can reach me at chris.kocic@gmail.com if you want. <3
